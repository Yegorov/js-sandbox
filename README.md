JavaScript Sandbox
==================

## Client side JS

* [Helping you select an MV* framework](http://todomvc.com/)

### Old School frameworks & libraries

#### [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/)

Vanilla JS is a fast, lightweight, cross-platform framework 
for building incredible, powerful JavaScript applications.

* [Habr translate](https://habrahabr.ru/post/150594/)
* [semicolon.js](https://github.com/madrobby/semicolon.js)

#### [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/)

Prototype takes the complexity out of client-side web programming. 
Built to solve real-world problems, it adds useful extensions 
to the browser scripting environment and provides elegant APIs around 
the clumsy interfaces of Ajax and the Document Object Model.

#### [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. 
It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, 
event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API 
that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility 
and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people 
write JavaScript.

#### [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)

Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models 
with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API 
of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, 
and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface. 

#### [Dojo](https://dojotoolkit.org/)

A JavaScript toolkit that saves you time and scales with your 
development process. Provides everything you need to build a Web app. 
Language utilities, UI components, and more, all in one place, 
designed to work together perfectly.

#### [MooTools](http://mootools.net)

MooTools is a compact, modular, Object-Oriented JavaScript framework designed 
for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer.

It allows you to write powerful, flexible, and cross-browser code 
with its elegant, well documented, and coherent API.

********************************************************************************

### Actual frameworks & libraries

#### [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

Vue is a progressive framework for building 
user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from 
the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused 
on the view layer only, and is very easy to pick up and integrate with 
other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly 
capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used 
in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

#### [Angular](https://angular.io/)

Angular is a development platform for building mobile 
and desktop web applications. 

#### [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. 
Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will 
efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. 
Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, 
and easier to debug.

* Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, 
then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in 
JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through 
your app and keep state out of the DOM.

* Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest 
of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without 
rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node 
and power mobile apps using React Native.

See also [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) - 
Application Architecture for Building User Interfaces

#### [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

Preact is a fast, 3kB alternative to React, with the same ES2015 API.

Preact retains a large amount of compatibility with React, but only the modern 
(ES6 Classes and stateless functional components) interfaces. 
As one would expect coming from React, Components are simple building blocks 
for composing a User Interface.

#### [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)

Ember.js is a Javascript framework that greatly reduces the time, 
effort and resources needed to build any web application. 
It is focused on making you, the developer, as productive as possible 
by doing all the common, repetitive, yet essential, tasks involved 
in most web development projects.

Ember.js also provides access to the most advanced features of Javascript, 
HTML and the Browser giving you everything you need to create your next killer 
web app.

#### [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)

Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web 
and mobile applications. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for 
building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and 
a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.

* Meteor allows you to develop in one language, JavaScript, 
in all environments: application server, web browser, and mobile device.

* Meteor uses data on the wire, meaning the server sends data, not HTML, 
and the client renders it.

* Meteor embraces the ecosystem, bringing the best parts of the extremely 
active JavaScript community to you in a careful and considered way.

* Meteor provides full stack reactivity, allowing your UI to seamlessly 
reflect the true state of the world with minimal development effort.


#### [Marionette.js](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette)

Marionette is a composite application library for Backbone.js that aims to 
simplify the construction of large scale JavaScript applications. It is 
a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in applications.

#### [Riot](http://riotjs.com/)

Simple and elegant component-based UI library

#### [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/)

The magical disappearing UI framework.

* The web's obesity crisis, solved. Svelte turns your templates into tiny, 
framework-less vanilla JavaScript.
* Simple and familiar. Build apps out of composable, easy-to-write blocks 
using languages you already know.
* Stupid fast, rock solid. Compile-time static analysis ensures the browser 
does no more work than it needs to.

### Other things for browsers

* [Asynchronous Module Definition](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)

#### [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)

RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. 
It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in other 
JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. Using a modular script loader 
like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code.

#### [browserify](http://browserify.org/)

browser-side require() the node.js way.

`require('modules')` in the browser.

Use a node-style require() to organize your browser code and load modules 
installed by npm.

order to build a bundle you can serve up to the browser in a single 
`<script>` tag.
